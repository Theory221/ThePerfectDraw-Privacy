Introduction
Alan Schmidt (“I,” “me,” or “my”) operate the ThePerfectDraw mobile application (the “App”). I am committed to respecting your privacy and protecting any personal information you may provide through the App. This Privacy Policy explains what information I collect, how I use it, and your rights regarding that information.

Information I Collect
	1.	User-Provided Information:
	•	Profile Data: You may choose to provide your name, city, state, and an optional profile image. This information is stored on your device and used solely within the App to personalize your experience.
	•	Cigar Check-Ins: When you log cigar check-ins (including cigar name, shape, and rating), these entries are saved locally on your device.
	2.	Automatically Collected Information:
	•	The App does not automatically collect any personally identifiable information or usage data. I do not use analytics tools or track user behavior outside of what is directly input by the user.
	3.	No Third-Party Data Collection:
	•	The App does not use third-party analytics, advertising networks, or social media integrations that collect personal information.

How I Use Your Information
	•	Personalization: Your provided name, location (city and state), and profile image are displayed within the App to enhance your experience. For example, your profile image may appear when you view your check-ins.
	•	Local Storage: All data (profile information and check-ins) are stored locally on your device. I do not have access to this data, nor do I upload it to my servers.

Data Sharing and Disclosure
	•	No External Sharing: I do not share, sell, or rent your personal information with any third parties.
	•	Legal Requirements: I may disclose information if required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena or court order, or if I believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with legal obligations.

Data Security
	•	I do not transmit your personal data over the internet. All data remains stored locally on your device. It is protected by your device’s security measures (e.g., passcode, Face ID, Touch ID).
	•	However, no method of electronic storage is completely secure. I cannot guarantee absolute security.

User Rights and Choices
	•	Access and Changes: You can update or delete your profile information within the App at any time.
	•	Data Deletion: If you uninstall the App, all locally stored data (profile information and check-ins) will be deleted from your device. We do not retain any copies of your data.

Children’s Privacy
	•	The App is not directed toward children period and anyone under the age of 18. I do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe I have inadvertently collected such information, please contact me so I can promptly remove it.

International Users
	•	The App is intended for use worldwide. Since data remains local on your device, there are no international data transfers.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
	•	I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When I do, I will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. I encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
